# Purchase Orders

*As of Sales Pack v2.0.*

The Purchase Orders feature is available in [Sales Pack](https://www.espocrm.com/extensions/sales-pack/).

Purchase Orders are issued to suppliers. They indicate what products the company needs to buy from the supplier, their quantities and arranged prices.

Access to Purchase Orders is controlled by Roles.

The Purchase Order has the *Supplier* field. Upon selecting a supplier, the Purchase Order address fields will be automatically populated. The selected supplier also determines prices that will be applied for products in the order.

Purchase Orders can be printed to PDF and sent in an email.

Multiple [Receipt Orders](receipt-orders.md) can be created from a Purchase Order.
